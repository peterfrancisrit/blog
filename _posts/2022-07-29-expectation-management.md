<!-- - LOGLINE: INCITING INCIDENT -->
Data Scientists love expectations, but how do we feel about managing them? I've spent the past year attempting to bring expectation under a new light. The struggle is real, and it hit me like a truck: I did not manage my expectations. 
<br></br>
<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
What is **Expectation Management**. Firstly, don't worry about it, it's essentially how one manages expectations; the other details don't matter all too much. To drive the point home, expectation management answers the question, "when I give you something to do, what *exactly* will you do?" It's often overlooked, and easier said than done, yet it's a tuned skill constrained by its dynamic environment. Interpretation changes from person-to-person. Well, this is all great and good, but where do we go from here; how can we improve our "Expectation Management" ability. 
<br></br>
<!-- GO: WHAT DO I WANT -->
The goal here is a dynamic framework that aims at bringing in immediate involvement from all backgrounds. Winning technical minds early in the process is a big win; improving communication and transparency. Another effect we're aiming for here is to generate buy-in of key upper-level stakeholders. At the end of the day, this is our ammunition, and ammunition is necessary for us. Data Scientists are shrouded by a world of uncertainty; not only within their specific domain, also within the Data Science *hype*. Without ammunition, we proactively ignore separating *hype* from *reality*; leaving behind an ambitious project almost never reaching to fruition. I'm sure the PTSD is real for some of you right now -- my condolensces. 
<br></br>
When it comes to a dynamic framework, the proof is in the pudding: there is no unique solution. However, we shall persist, pause to reflect, and remind ourselves, "we are Data Scientists: uncertainty is in our blood!" Chant the mantra atop the highest peak, and Thomas Bayes himself will bless you -- I do, however, have no *prior* information on that theory. Jokes aside, I propose  
<!-- NAVIGATE: WHAT HAPPES IN THIS NEW WORLD, WHAT'S IT LIKE WITH EXPECTATION MANAGEMENT  -->
The first step is to first identify your audience, and we can achieve this through answering a few basic questions:
- who do I report to? 
- who are the key stakeholders? 
- what is the breadth of technical capability: is it all high level management, or are we talking a team of Enigma crackers? 
- what forms of communication are used: small group meetings, to large, terrifying corporate presentations?
<br></br>
<!-- GET WHAT YOU WANT: YOU NOW HAVE EXPECTATION MANAGEMENT -->
Now, you have your process let's use an example and apply it. Let's say blah blah. 
Add an example. What are the outcomes, you get the expectation management.

<!-- PAY A PRICE: WHAT HAPPENS, MAYBE IT'S A GREAT THING? -->
THe price to pay is you are prepared to say no to projects, 

My experience with expectation management
- I've had colleagues dismiss work for being uncomplete, we didn't understand what we expected from each other
- To newbies of Data Science, they have no idea what to expect
