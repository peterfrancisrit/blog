title: "Expectation Management: Data Scientists' Ammunition"

<!-- - LOGLINE: INCITING INCIDENT -->
Data Scientists love expectations, but how do we feel about managing them? I've spent the past year attempting to bring expectation under a new light. The struggle is real, and it hit me like a truck: I did not manage my expectations. 
<br></br>
<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
What is **Expectation Management**. Firstly, don't worry about it, it's essentially how one manages expectations; the other details don't matter all too much. To drive the point home, expectation management answers the question, "when I give you something to do, what *exactly* will you do?" It's often overlooked, and easier said than done, yet it's a tuned skill constrained by its dynamic environment. Interpretation changes from person-to-person. Well, this is all great and good, but where do we go from here; how can we improve our "Expectation Management" ability. 
<br></br>
<!-- GO: WHAT DO I WANT -->
The goal here is a dynamic framework that aims at involving technical minds early and generating the buy-in of key upper-level stakeholders; consequentially, arming ourselves with the necessary ammunition we solemnly need. Ammunition is necessary for us. Data Scientists are shrouded by a world of uncertainty; not only within the domain-specific problem, also by the Data Science *hype*. Without our ammunition, we proactively ignore separating *hype* from *reality*; leaving behind an ambitious project never reaching fruition. I'm sure the PTSD is real for some of you right now -- my condolensces. 
The first step is to first identify your audience, and we can achieve this through answering a few basic questions:
- who do I report to? 
- who are the key stakeholders? 
- what is the breadth of technical capability: is it all high level management, or are we talking a team of Enigma crackers? 
- what forms of communication are used: small group meetings, to large, terrifying corporate presentations?

<!-- NEW WORLD: WHAT HAPPES IN THIS NEW WORLD, WHAT'S IT LIKE WITH EXPECTATION MANAGEMENT  -->
<br></br>
<!-- GET WHAT YOU WANT: YOU NOW HAVE EXPECTATION MANAGEMENT -->
<br></br>
PAY A PRICE: WHAT HAPPENS, MAYBE IT'S A GREAT THING?

My experience with expectation management
- I've had colleagues dismiss work for being uncomplete, we didn't understand what we expected from each other
- To newbies of Data Science, they have no idea what to expect
