They call them small emotions.<br>
You know, the not-so-angry,<br>
The so-so,<br>
The not-what-I-don't-know,<br>
But the unpleasant ones I know.
<br><br>
Small emotions: the ones that linger,<br>
Like a child at the pool: non-threatening, spashing endlessly.
<br><br>
Small emotions: a swift strike.<br>
A pinch to the brain.<br>
A reminder, "don't forget you're unhappy!"
<br><br>
Small emotions: a brief gust of wind, that carries you high up into the sky,<br>
And leaves you plummitting towards your stomach.
<br><br>
The emotions we neglect,<br>
Like the insects,<br>
Under the fridge,<br>
Congregating.<br>
Collaborating.<br>
Co-habitating.
<br><br>
Don't forget them.<br>
They surely haven't forgotten you.<br>
And every night when the light flickers,<br>
Don't be surprised,<br>
When out trickles,<br>
One curious insect.
