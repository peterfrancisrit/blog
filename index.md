title: "Softer Sides of Data"

I'm glad you are here. Let's be honest, you and I both know there are plenty of thorough, technical Data Science blogs out there. I approach this from the softer-side: the communication side. I hope I don't come off as *meta* or *woke* -- technical blogs are rough the: math is just hard! So, sit back, relax, pour yourself a single-origin espresso, and enjoy mediocrity.
